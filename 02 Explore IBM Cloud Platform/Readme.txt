Explore IBM Cloud Platform
What is the IBM Cloud platform?

The IBM® cloud platform combines platform as a service (PaaS) with infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to provide an integrated experience. The platform scales and supports both small development teams and organizations, and large enterprise businesses. Globally deployed across data centers around the world, the solution you build on IBM Cloud™ spins up fast and performs reliably in a tested and supported environment you can trust.

The platform is built to support your needs whether it's working only in the public cloud or taking advantage of a multicloud deployment model. With our open-source technologies, such as Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift, and a full range of compute options, including virtual machines, containers, bare metal, and serverless, you have as much control and flexibility as you need to support workloads in your hybrid environment. You can deploy cloud-native apps while also ensuring workload portability.

Whether you need to migrate apps to the cloud, modernize your existing apps by using cloud services, ensure data resiliency against regional failure, or leverage new paradigms and deployment topologies to innovate and build your cloud-native apps, the platform's open architecture is built to accommodate your use case.
